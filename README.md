This is a hands-on Proof of Concept (PoC) showcasing a PDF and document large language model (LLM) search and visualization system leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Generative AI. The solution enables zero-code uploading of PDF or document files directly into the system, where they are automatically processed and converted into vector embeddings to build a vector database on the fly.

When a user submits a natural language query, the system transforms the query into query vectors and performs a semantic search on the dynamically built vector database to retrieve the most relevant document chunks. These retrieved chunks are then combined with the user's query to create an augmented prompt for the LLM, enhancing context awareness and response accuracy.

Additionally, the solution visualizes the search results by preserving the original document structure, showing both textual snippets and corresponding document page images to maintain layout, tables, figures, and visual context. This multimodal approach helps the LLM understand the documents more thoroughly and reduces hallucinations by grounding answers in accurate source data.

The key advantages are:

Zero-code, seamless file upload and ingestion of documents into the AI pipeline.

Automatic vector database creation and maintenance, enabling scalable real-time document search.

Enhanced LLM responses by combining retrieved factual content with generative capabilities.

Visual presentation of document content alongside answers for better user comprehension.

Flexibility to handle various document types and sizes, preserving document visuals.

This PoC is an excellent example of integrating RAG with document LLM search, visualization, and zero-code document ingestion, ideal for enterprise knowledge management, research assistance, or customer support automation systems.
